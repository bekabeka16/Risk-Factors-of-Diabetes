Identifying Key Risk Factors for Diabetes and Developing Prevention Strategies

Collaborated with a team (Data-betics) to analyze key risk factors for diabetes using the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. Focused on feature selection, model building, and evaluation to identify significant predictors like high blood pressure (HighBP) and general health (GenHlth). Built decision tree classifier, visualized results through heatmaps and decision tree diagrams, and addressed challenges like class imbalance and data bias. Presented findings via a comprehensive report and poster, emphasizing actionable insights for diabetes prevention strategies.
